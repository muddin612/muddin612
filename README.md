# Hi there, I'm Mohammed Uddin! 👋

### 🚀 Aspiring Software Engineer | MSU Alum | Tech Enthusiast

I discovered my passion for building things back in 2019 during my 11th-grade AP Computer Science class. That spark led me to **Montclair State University**, where I earned my B.S. in **Computer Science** with a minor in **Data Science** (Class of Spring 2024). 

Now, I’m focused on building scalable web applications and exploring the intersection of software development and data insights.

### 🎣 Beyond the Code
When I'm not at my desk, you can usually find me:
- **Fishing:** Catching some sun (and hopefully fish) during the spring and summer.
- **Tennis:** Keeping active on the court.
- **Building:** I just love the process of creating things from scratch, whether it's code or a DIY project.

*"The best way to predict the future is to create it."*
